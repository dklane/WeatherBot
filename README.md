# WeatherBot

Have you ever received an alert on your mobile device or weather radio and wondered what the alert meant or what you should do during the alert? Weather Bot is pretty simple, it gives general information on what you should do if said alert is ever issued along with giving some tips on what to do when one is issued. Of course in the future this will not be the only thing Weather Bot does, but as of now that is its sole purpose currently.
